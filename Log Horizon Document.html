<H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always"><A NAME="__RefHeading__105_1832199561"></A>
Overview</H1>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The Log Horizon project is essentially working off of Mana World
project in core programming in some aspects. Majority of art assets
that include, but not limited to icons, splash screen, tile sets,
mini-maps and various shader effects. The Log Horizon have some very
notable difference compared to Mana World and the main focus is to
make programming accessible to everyone so everyone can contribute
with ease and even the artists who have no knowledge in programming
can apply their work on this project.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The Log Horizon project will be drastically different to Mana
Project in several aspects to enable smooth transition for player's
game-play experience and more flexibility for artists to accomplish
their goal to recreate the world in their vision.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__119_1832199561"></A>The
Vision for Log Horizon Project</H2>
<P>In my vision the game should feels like a 3D game with a more
dynamic environment with active wilderness, an active economy,
dynamic coloring and shading of sprites with applied color theory for
changing day cycle, players building their own home, a government run
by players and AI (People of the Land), events that trigger wars and
chaos across the land, and so forth. 
</P>
<P>When I fly on Dragon, Griffon, or whatever creature that fly, the
game show a menu to select a destination and I can select an
undetermined destination and the client would generate motion blurred
map to animate flight to my destination and I can modify my course if
I wish during the flight similar to Log Horizon anime. I see a
campfire near the destination I was going to land, I decided to go
off course to a safe distance, however it is normally very difficult
to spot a campfire unless it is during the night with large fire.
Almost always the campfire can indicate a NPC camp, though it is
rarely a player's camp and it is usually posed too big of a risk to
land directly in the middle of the camp.</P>
<P>When I land at my destination, I would call my friend via
telepathy which would open a chat channel for 1 on 1 communication to
invite him into a party. When I wait, I would set up a tent,
campfire, and cook foods that is easy to prepare depending on my
level and subclass. I will also accompany the animal I rode on by
feeding it and let it be free while in game mechanic, it would simply
vanish when leaving far enough from the player only to return
instantly when player call for it. I would occasionally see wolves,
deers, elks, and birds roaming around my tent and hour pass, I would
see my tent become less tan and more orange during the twilight hour
then dark blue during the night with soft tint of orange ting on the
tent facing the campfire. 
</P>
<P>When I eat a cooked meat, I see my character have satisfied hunger
status and being in a happier mood and mending my cut that I received
in my recent fight. I proceed to draw a map onto paper, because when
I die in game, I lose my memory of the whereabouts and details on the
map and it is also a valuable resource for other players who may need
it, because game can't be normally mapped like a non-changing
environment like World of Warcraft, but environment is being affected
by many events and actions of the players and AI alike. The worst
event of them all would be the World Fraction, because everything
changes all at once.</P>
<P>I proceed to log out at my tent to save my progress however the
tent can be disturbed if it is not well hidden or I was being
followed. I can be killed in my camp by another player or NPC if I
have not set up the proper countermeasures such as setting up traps,
diversion, and misdirections.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>A lot of those ideas are all what I want to see in a game like Log
Horizon to bring a sense of realism to a game similar to DayZ. A lot
of those ideas can be accomplished by tackling one step at a time and
leaving mechanism open to changes and being flexible to new ideas.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__107_1832199561"></A>OpenGL
with OpenTK</H2>
<P>OpenGL is going to be the core of the gaming experience. The most
important reason for going with OpenGL is to enable more advanced
control of rendering the game with the features of shading, texture
filtering, rapid rendering, motion blurring and cross platform
compatibility.</P>
<P>The possibility with OpenGL is endless, with OpenGL it is possible
to render Flying scene over the world map with tons of mix of
shading, color degradation, motion blurring, and bringing 3D feels to
a 2D game. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__109_1832199561"></A>Network
Overhaul</H2>
<P>The network aspect of Mana Project will have an overhaul for
network protocol to improve the security to thwart hacking attempts,
high ping game play (600 ms) and safeguard player's information. The
protocol will be lay out in the future as the design isn't decided
yet. As for internal logic for network handling, the project will
focus on optimize threading design to accommodate 1,000 players
connectivity. The project will need to be redetermined for cluster
servers design if the demand arise to exceed more than 10,000 players
connectivity.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__111_1832199561"></A>The
Game Engine</H2>
<P>Most of the game logic will be worked off of Mana Project to apply
the gaming logic such as tile mapping, collision, combat, dialogues,
menu layout, and so forth. However, some of the logic will be
modified to support a more seamless game-play and support a more
dynamic environment such as crafting, building houses, after-effect
of a fight, and so to speak.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__121_1832199561"></A>Documentation
Requirement</H2>
<P>As many may disagree, the Log Horizon is going to focus most of
the resources on documentation, because this entirely eliminate
repeated efforts, allowing new developers to contribute with ease,
and solving a potential design issue at a much earlier stage.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__115_1832199561"></A>Dynamic
Game Mechanic</H2>
<P>The focus of the project is going to be on Dynamic Game Mechanic
to allow flexibility to extend new rules to the game or to remove the
old rules as well as applying different effect to the game. The
mechanism of this is to allow an easier implementation for a game
changing effect. For an example, game may start out a simple RPG as a
turn based combat, then evolve into a real time combat system which
eliminate turn based combat and allow a more dynamic combat scenario.
This mechanism aims to eliminate the need of implementing mods and
allow the developer to create the game that matches their vision.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__117_1832199561"></A>AI
Programming</H2>
<P>In the future, the project will focus on AI interface to allow
developers to contribute by programming in Lua, Python (Via
IronPython), C#, C, C++, D, and so forth. The client will allow
dynamic AI loading to offer developer better control on developing
new AI. AI programming will not only apply to NPC, but also can apply
as a mechanism to world changing environment. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__124_1832199561"></A>Flexibility
to Creating Different Games</H2>
<P>Part of the goal of this project is to set up a system to allow
different community to create and implement their own game in their
own vision. This will create an ecosystem of modification and ideas
for several communities to contribute to the project to improve the
game for everyone.</P>
